Coding Dojo Assignment: HTML Table

Objectives:
Get comfortable passing information from the route to the template
Get very comfortable iterating through a list of dictionaries to generate a html output.
Pass users to your template and have your template output an HTML table like this:

First Name	Last Name	Full Name
Michael	Choi	Michael Choi
John	Supsupin	John Supsupin
Mark	Guillen	Mark Guillen

As you need to get into the habit of making your assignment look nice, we challenge you to use either Bootstrap or Foundation. If you haven't dabbled with these frameworks, start by learning just enough to do this assignment (creating a nice looking table).
